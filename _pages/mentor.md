# Join as a Mentor

New mentors are always welcome!

If you want to help out and become a mentor, you can join [our Mailing List](https://framalistes.org/sympa/info/coderdojo-zh) or simply show up at one of our weekly events.

## What does it need?

You should have fun spending time with kids, you should be ready to learn Scratch (or bring other fitting programming skill) and being ready to spend at least one Sunday afternoon a month at the CoderDojo.
