Our weekly meetings help you to write your code, develop websites or program apps and games. 

You will learn much more out of this sessions if you can attend regularly. Of course it does not have to be every week.

Bring your own laptop. If needed, we can also provide computers on demand.

No constant supervision by parents is necessary. Parents can relax in our small lounge.
