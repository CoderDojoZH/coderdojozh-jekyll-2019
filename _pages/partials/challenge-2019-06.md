## CoderDojo Summer Finale 2019 & Cyber Protection Challenge

Sunday, June 23rd
14:00 – 17:30

In January we had the CoderDojo Season kickoff event. Together with Zurich Insurance we announced a new challenge for our Ninjas with the topic _Cyber Protection_.

Ninjas who join the challenge, have 3 months to make a game, presentation, quiz, short story or program relating to _Cyber Projetection_ and are welcome to present their project on June 23rd.

The event will be at the beautiful Zurich Development Center (Keltenstrasse 48, 8044 Zürich).

You'll need to register before June 18th at: <https://airtable.com/shrcm1DJsN0xu2Ha8>

During the Summer Final we will have the usual Lightbot, Scratch and Python/Lua sessions. You can read more details [on our meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/Coder-Dojo-Zurich/events/261780281/). (Please, don't forget that for the season final you need to also register on [Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrcm1DJsN0xu2Ha8)!)

We will be very happy to meet you during the challenge final and later during regular CoderDojo sessions.
