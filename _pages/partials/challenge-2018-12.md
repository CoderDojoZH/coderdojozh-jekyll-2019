## Protect Your Home challenge final
Sunday, December 9th  
14:00 â€“ 17:30

In September 2018 we had the CoderDojo Season kickoff event. Together with Zurich Insurance we announced a new challenge for our Ninjas with the topic _Protect your home_.

Ninjas who join the challenge, have 3 months to make a game, presentation, quiz, short story or program anything else in the challenge's theme.

During the challenge final some of the Ninjas will present their projects made over last weeks. 

We will be very happy to meet you during the challenge final and later during regular CoderDojo sessions.
